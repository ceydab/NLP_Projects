# LLM and NLP Projects
Welcome to NLP Projects repository! This repository hosts various Python scripts, each representing a different project related to Large Language Models (LLMs) or Natural Language Processing (NLP) using machine learning techniques. 

## **Projects Included**
1. **Text Classification**: Classifying texts into different categories of languages utilizing vanilla machine learning techniques.

2. **Text Classification with Neural Networks**: Classifying texts into different categories of languages utilizing neural networks.

3. **Text Embedding**: Embedding different datasets using CBOW and Skipgram.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**: This project aims to perform sentiment analysis through tweets, utilizing CNN.

5. **Named Entity Recognition**: This project aims to perform ner utilizing transformers and BERT.

6. **Sentiment Intensity**: This project aims to perform sentiment intensity analysis utilizing transformers.

7. **Topic Modelling**: This project is a practice of topic modelling using LDA and CTM.

8. **LLama Fine-Tuning**: This project finetune LLama to assist with the taxes.

9. **ASR&T2S**: This project utilizes automatic-speech-recognition and tts pipelines in order to create a small model that can take in a text, convert it into audio, and transcribes the audio again.

Each project is contained within its own .py or .ipynb file, along with outputs and explanations of the code.

## **Note**
This repository reflects my learning journey and includes practical applications of NLP techniques. It will continue to be updated with new projects and improvements over time.
