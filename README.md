# NLP_Projects
Welcome to NLP Projects repository! This repository hosts various Python scripts written in colab, each representing a different project related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using machine learning techniques. 

## **Projects Included**
1. **Text Classification**: Classifying text documents into different categories using NLP techniques. Two files are included. The first one utilizes only machine learning techniques. The second one includes an application of neural networks.
2. **Text Embedding**: Embedding different datasets using CBOW and Skipgram.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: This project aims to perform sentiment analysis through tweets, utilizing CNN.

Each project is contained within its own .py or .ipynb file, along with outputs and explanations of the code.

## **Note**
This repository reflects my learning journey and includes practical applications of NLP techniques. It will continue to be updated with new projects and improvements over time.
