# NLP_Projects
Welcome to NLP Projects repository! This repository hosts various Python scripts written in colab, each representing a different project related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using machine learning techniques. 

## **Projects Included**
1. **Text Classification**: Classifying text documents into different categories using NLP techniques.
2. **Text Embedding**: Embedding different datasets using CBOW and Skipgram.

Each project is contained within its own .py file, along with outputs and explanations of the code.

## **Note**
This repository reflects my learning journey and includes practical applications of NLP techniques. It will continue to be updated with new projects and improvements over time.
