# NLP_Projects
Welcome to NLP Projects repository! This repository hosts various Python scripts written in colab, each representing a different project related to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using machine learning techniques. 

## **Projects Included**
1.1 **Text Classification**: Classifying texts into different categories using NLP techniques. Two files are included. The first one utilizes only machine learning techniques. 
1.2 **Text Classification with Neural Networks**: The second one includes an application of neural networks to classify texts into categories of different languages.
2. **Text Embedding**: Embedding different datasets using CBOW and Skipgram.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: This project aims to perform sentiment analysis through tweets, utilizing CNN.
4. **Named Entity Recognition**: This project aims to perform ner utilizing transformers and BERT.


Each project is contained within its own .py or .ipynb file, along with outputs and explanations of the code.

## **Note**
This repository reflects my learning journey and includes practical applications of NLP techniques. It will continue to be updated with new projects and improvements over time.
